Job 22: 
        Aligning sequences to config/oc43a_rdrp_reference.gb
          - filling gaps with N
        

[Fri Aug  7 19:00:04 2020]
Error in rule align:
    jobid: 22
    output: results/aligned_s1.fasta
    shell:
        
        augur align             --sequences results/sequences_s1.fasta             --reference-sequence config/oc43a_rdrp_reference.gb             --output results/aligned_s1.fasta             --fill-gaps
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job align since they might be corrupted:
results/aligned_s1.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
