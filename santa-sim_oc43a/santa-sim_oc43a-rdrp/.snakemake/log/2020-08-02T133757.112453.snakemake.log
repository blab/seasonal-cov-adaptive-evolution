Job 180: Simulating RDRP sequence data with SANTA-SIM

[Sun Aug  2 13:37:57 2020]
Error in rule santa_sim:
    jobid: 180
    output: data/simulated_rdrp_oc43a_s20.fasta
    shell:
        
        java -jar ../../../../santa-sim/dist/santa.jar config/oc43ardrp_s20.xml
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
