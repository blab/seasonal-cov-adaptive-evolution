Job 25: Simulating RDRP sequence data with SANTA-SIM

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 19 of /Users/katekistler/nextstrain/seasonal-cov/santa-sim_oc43a/santa-sim_oc43a-rdrp/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
data/simulated_rdrp_oc43a_s1_1.fasta
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
