Job 1: Formatting data simulated by SANTA-SIM for Augur

[Fri Jul 17 11:54:02 2020]
Error in rule format_data:
    jobid: 1
    output: data/simulated_oc43aspike_s1.fasta
    shell:
        
        scripts/format_simulated_data.py             --alignment data/simulated_oc43a_s1.fasta
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
