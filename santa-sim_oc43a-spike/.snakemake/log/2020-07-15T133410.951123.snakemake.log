Error in rule export:

    output: auspice/simulated_oc43a.json
    shell:
        
        augur export v2             --tree results/tree.nwk             --metadata results/metadata.tsv             --node-data results/branch_lengths.json results/nt_muts.json results/aa_muts.json             --auspice-config config/auspice_config.json             --output auspice/simulated_oc43a.json
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job export since they might be corrupted:
auspice/simulated_oc43a.json
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
