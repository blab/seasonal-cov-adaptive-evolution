Job 1: Simulating Spike sequence data with SANTA-SIM

[Fri Jul 17 11:25:04 2020]
Error in rule santa_sim:
    jobid: 1
    output: simulated_oc43_s1.fasta
    shell:
        
        java -jar ../../santa-sim/dist/santa.jar config/oc43aspike_s1.xml
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
